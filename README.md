<h3> How long will it take to burn off that burger? </h3>

<p> This personal project answers the question â€” Is the food item you crave worth it? The user searches for a food and the app calculates the number of minutes the user must exercise in order to burn it off. It uses Twitter OAuth for login and the Fitbit API for food data.</p>  <br>Tech Stack: Rails 4.2, Bootstrap, RSpec.
